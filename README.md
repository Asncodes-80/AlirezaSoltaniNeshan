I'm Alireza Soltani Neshan, and you can find me online at Alirezacodes. I am
a computer software engineering student, and I am very enthusiastic about
deepening my knowledge in this field. I have been a researcher and developer for
five years, and my current goal is to become proficient in both back-end and
front-end development. Recently, I have been engaged in learning about Genetic
Engineering, focusing particularly on pattern matching and data analysis in the
field of Bioinformatics and Healthcare 4.0. Additionally, I am currently working
on writing my papers such as survey and a novel system in digital Healthcare
4.0.
